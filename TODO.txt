High amount of Refactoring (3 days worth) due to all the new variables in weapon_init and projectile_init
send_ubyte/deserialization buffers in Character events to keep meter/ammo consistent
Meters syncing throughout weapon switch

Fix detonator unknown var error
Fix SEVERE loadout menu degradation that occurs when used continuously
Refactor, Cleanup or Organize:
Merge Crit-based variables Into one type instead of using multiple variables (as seen on SodaPopper's hyve call)
add global.delta_factor checks on ALL ALARMS/meters
High Prio:
remove 'charging' and 'hype', instead, use ability detection with abilityType, abilityVisual and abilityCharged
add weaponType and weaponGrade
High amount of Refactoring (3 days worth) due to all the new variables in weapon_init and projectile_init, build for weaponType/weaponGrade (In progress)


TESTING REQUIRED:
Soak an enemy with both milk, piss, and make em bleed
