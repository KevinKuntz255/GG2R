Fix detonator unknown var error
Fix SEVERE loadout menu degradation that occurs when used continuously
ERROR: Constantly flipping through weapons causes sprites to disappear (ev_create gets skipped?)
ERROR: Phlog can errorloop the player when switching or spawning, due to ev_draw conflict from above error

Refactor, Cleanup or Organize:
Implement auto-recharge for single use weapons (Bonk, Mad Milk, etc)

Kevin's High Priority:
make consumables/throwables piggyback owner.canEat as a detector
re-add crit variable/visuals to all projectiles due to buffBanner's addition
add shared Medic HealBeam/Needle
Finish NapalmGrenade (nvm, uses ClientBeginStep, ask MCBoss if there needs to be an override, or a different solution)

send and read_ubyte(variable, deserializationBuffer) for many projectiles and some weapons
move uberCharge from currentWeapon to Character
send and read_ubyte(variable, deserializationBuffer) in Character events to keep meter/ammo consistent throughout weapon switches (50%)

TESTING REQUIRED:
Soak an enemy with both milk, piss, and make em bleed

All:
Add Taunts (25%)
Make a sweeping check through all weapons to implement kill log through damSource (DAMAGE_SOURCE_WEAPON);
Implement taunts optimally (Per-Weapon Is not viable)

Implement:
Weapons:
Scout:
Rundown (optional, weapon works akin to Baby Face's Blaster)
Pyro:
Phlog (90%) Add Afterburn
Snowbite (90%) Add ev_draw override to Character for Snow/Freezing
Napalm Grenade (70%) Add Networking
Soldier:
Buff Banner (95%)
Cow Mangler (50%)
Heavy:
Iron Maiden
Dalokhos Bar (Implement overheal)
