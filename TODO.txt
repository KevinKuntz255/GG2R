High amount of Refactoring (3 days worth) due to all the new variables in weapon_init and projectile_init
send_ubyte/deserialization buffers in Character events to keep meter/ammo consistent
Meters syncing throughout weapon switch
RadioBlur just disappearing seems too abrupt, my last attempt to make RadioBlur fade out without an owner did not work.
SoldierLoadout does not get called properly, reverts to FAN/Scattergun, This was due to "player.playerLoadout" being -1, setting it to 0 breaks scout, commenting until later.
Fix detonator unknown var error
Fix SEVERE loadout menu degradation that occurs when used continuously
Refactor, Cleanup or Organize:
Merge Crit-based variables Into one type instead of using multiple variables (as seen on SodaPopper's hyve call)
add global.delta_factor checks on ALL ALARMS/meters
