Meters syncing throughout weapon switch (WIP)
as a reminder SoldierLoadout does not get called properly, reverts to FAN/Scattergun, This was due to "player.playerLoadout" being -1, setting it to 0 breaks scout, commenting until later.
Fix detonator unknown var error
Fix SEVERE loadout menu degradation that occurs when used continuously

Refactor, Cleanup or Organize:
Merge Crit-based variables Into one abilityType instead of using multiple variables (as seen on SodaPopper's hyve call)
add global.delta_factor checks on ALL ALARMS/meters (WIP)

Kevin's High Priority:
Finish NapalmGrenade
add shared GrenadeLauncher type
add shared Medic Weapons

make consumables (only BonkHand so far) piggyback owner.canEat as a detector
High amount of Refactoring due to all the new variables in weapon_init and projectile_init, build for weaponType/weaponGrade (75%)
send and read_ubyte(variable, deserializationBuffer) for many projectiles and some weapons
send and read_ubyte(variable, deserializationBuffer) in Character events to keep meter/ammo consistent throughout weapon switches

TESTING REQUIRED:
Soak an enemy with both milk, piss, and make em bleed

All:
add global.delta_factor checks on ALL ALARMS/meters
Merge Crit-based variables Into one type instead of using multiple variables (as seen on SodaPopper's hyve call)
Add Taunts (WIP)
replace loaded1 or loaded2 calls with weapons[0] and weapons[1] calls (check projectile_init)
Make a sweeping check through all weapons to implement kill log through damSource (DAMAGE_SOURCE_WEAPON);
Implement taunts optimally

Implement:
Weapons:
Scout:
Atomizer (95%) Add Tauntkill
Rundown (optional, weapon works akin to Baby Face's Blaster)
Pyro:
